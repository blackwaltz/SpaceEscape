This is my learning project to test my java and photoshop skills.
When I finished studying java book my friend told me to try to make infinite runner game. And this is what I came up with. 
Speed is increasing with time. Mouse control. Acceleration to make game more interesting. No weapons, levels or other bonuses because I don't ned it in testing project.

There are all source files and .exe file.
